# midimonitor
Midimonitor displays incoming MIDI messages in a web-browser using the WebMIDI API.

MIDI is a communication standard describing how musical instruments can communicate with computers, other musical instruments, or other hardware. 

Midimonitor is a single page and single file web application with no external dependencies (well, it downloads a free font from Google, but will work just fine without it).

This is the first web application I created using the WebMIDI API, so it's been my way of learning this API.
